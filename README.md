# Association-Rules-and-Safety-Data

Adam McKinnon and I decided to explore the use of association rules to help prevent safety incidents. Workplace safety datasets are not readily available, so weâ€™ve decided to use a dataset of UK vehicle incidents to demonstrate how this analysis could be done.

Adam and I use different languages (I use Python and he uses R), so we wanted to leverage the strengths of each. As such, I used Python for all data exploration and data prep, and to run the apriori algorithm (code included in this notebook). Adam then used R to create the visualizations (not included here).

An article will be published soon that includes those visualizations, as well as the code.
